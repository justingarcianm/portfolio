				<h3>Blog Site</h3>
				<p>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes has made me love mobile games. Being a huge Star Wars fan, it was a no brainer to create a blog site for the game. Although, there are already forums dedicated to this type of content; I wanted to cerate a clean look with more opportunities to find what you need if you play the game as seroiusly as I do.</p>
				<p>This site uses Node JS with Express to create multiple pages that uses the CRUD method for posts as well as comments. I used Materialize CSS and vanilla javascript within ejs. A Twitter API is used to keep up to date with current game features.</p>
				<p>I took this project from a completed project I created from a online course, I knew it would be a great challenge to take that knowledge into a new enviornment and the experience gained from it was worth it.</p>
